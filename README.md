# HTML_CSS_JavaScript_DailyPlanner
Complete Daily Planner.

Complete Daily Planner, which contains date and time that update automatically, progress bar to control the amount of glasses of water taken in the day, to do list with the option to show and hide the its items and another button to mark the task as achieved, a list automatically fed with the objectives from the to do list achieved in the day, box for general notes, shopping list with buttons to add and remove items and last but not least a simple calculator.

For this project I uploaded the files to my student Azure account to make the Daily webpage accessible via an Azure endpoint link.
